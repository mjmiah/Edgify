# How to use
* Move the images you want to edge detect into the input folder. Remember that these **input files must be of the .jpg format**. The input and output folders already contain samples I edge detected which you can delete if you wish to do so.
* Run the Edgify.exe file.

* Once the all the input images have been edge detected, the window will say 'Done' and close.
* You can check your output folder for the edge detected images.
