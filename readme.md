# How to use
* Move the images you want to edge detect into the input folder. Remember that these **input files must be of the .jpg format**. The input and output folders already contain samples I edge detected which you can delete if you wish to do so.
* Open the edgify.m file in MATLAB.
* Type 'edgify()' in the MATLAB Command Window.

* Once it says 'Done', you can check your output folder for the edge detected images.
